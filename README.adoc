= Secure Microservices with OAuth 2.0 and JWT
Time: 10 minutes

== Learning objectives

* OAuth 2.0
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* How to secure a microservice with the Tribestream API Gateway (TAG)
* Authorization using roles

== Prerequisites

* Docker installed and running.
* Curl installed.


== Run Docker Containers

Before digging into OAuth2 using TAG you need start the docker images of ElasticSearch and Kibana, TAG and the Movie-Api app.

=== Start the Movies Microservice

If you went through the _Tribestream Quickstart Guide_ you can reuse the _movie-api_ docker container. To start the movie-api execute the following command:
```
docker start movie-api
```

However, if this is the first time you hear about the `movie-api`, open the terminal and execute the following command.


```
docker run -d -p 9090:9090 --name movie-api  tomitribedev/movie-api
```

You can validate that the microservice is up and running by executing the command below:

```
curl -i http://localhost:9090/movie-api/api/movies
```

You should be able to see the movie-api microservice output:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

=== Run the Tribestream API Gateway (TAG)

If you went through the _Tribestream Quickstart Guide_ you can reuse the _TAG_ docker container. To start TAG execute the following command:

```
docker start tag
```

However, if this is the first time you run TAG, open the terminal and execute the following command.

For linux:
```
docker run --net="host" -e LICENSE=accept --name tag -p 8080:8080 tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway
```

For OSX:
```
docker run -e LICENSE=accept --name tag -p 8080:8080  tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway`
```

TAG is ready when you see the following message in the logs:
```
INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["http-bio-8080"]
INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["ajp-bio-8009"]
INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in 18348 ms
```

== What is OAuth 2.0
OAuth2 is an open standard for authorization that enables client applications to access server resources on behalf of a specific Resource Owner which also enables the owner to authorize limited third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials.

The Tribestream API Gateway will help you to easily configure OAuth2 to protect your microservices. TAG issues tokens for the client applications on behalf of a Resource Owner, these tokens added to the request can be used to access the protected microservices.

== What is JSON Web Token (JWT)
JSON Web Token is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

TAG emits the access tokens using the JWT format. The emitted tokens will have all the claims with the necessary information like roles, groups, expiration date and others, thus TAG can authorize or deny access to a microservice.

== How to secure a microservice with the Tribestream API Gateway (TAG)

Open the browser and navigate to link:http://localhost:8080/tag[,window="_blank"].

Login into the TAG dashboard using username: _admin_, password: _admin_.

=== Create a Client Account

Create the client account you are going to use, following the steps below:

* Click on the _Accounts_
* Click the _Plus button_ (+)
* Select _Account_

Create a new Account with the following data:

* *Username*: _movieapp_
* *Email*: _movieapp@email.com_
* *Full Name*: _Movie App Client_

image::create-client-account.png[""]

After clicking _Save_ you will be redirected to a page with all the movieapp account information.

Add a Client Secret with the following steps: +

* Click the _…_
* Select _Add Client Secret_ on the menu

Use the following data in the _Add Client Secret_ window: +

* *New Client Secret*: _tomitribe_
* *Re-type*: _tomitribe_
* *OAuth Security Profile*: _OAuth2 Profile_
* Click _Save_

image::add-client-secret.png[""]

To create the accounts _Alice_ and _Bob_, please look on link:https://tribestream.io/guide/en/api-gateway/quickstart/master/#_4_secure_your_microservice[Step 4,window="_blank"] from the link:https://tribestream.io/guide/en/api-gateway/quickstart/master/[TAG Quickstart, window="_blank"] or just execute the follow curl commands that will use the TAG Rest API to create them for you:

```
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/tag/api/account/ --insecure --header 'accept: application/json' --header 'authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' --header 'cache-control: no-cache' --header 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"username": "bob","email": "bob@email.com","displayName": "Bob","roles": [{"displayName": "user","name": "user","id": "user"}],"credentials": {"password": {"active": true,"value": "superpassword"}}}'
```
```
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/tag/api/account/ --insecure --header 'accept: application/json' --header 'authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' --header 'cache-control: no-cache' --header 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"username": "alice","email": "alice@email.com","displayName": "Alice","roles": [{"displayName": "administrator","name": "administrator","id": "usadministrator"}],"credentials": {"password": {"active": true,"value": "supersecret"}}}'
```

=== Create a Route with the OAuth2 Security Profile

On the Dashboard page execute the following steps:

* Click on the _Routes_
* Click the _Plus button_(+)
* Select _MOD_REWRITE ROUTE_

Then fill the form with the following data:

* Add the MOD_REWRITE description below
```
RewriteRule "^/movies$" "http://localhost:9090/movie-api/api/movies" [P,NE,auth]
```
PS: If you are using OSX as the operating system, replace _localhost_ for _host.docker.internal_.

* *Security Profiles*: _OAuth2 Profile_
* *Roles*: _Administrator_

image::create-route.png[""]

After clicking _Save_ you will be on the page of your created route. You now have a route _/movies_ secured with OAuth2 and only calls from accounts with the role _Administrator_ will be proxied to the movies microservice.

== Calling the Movies Microservice
You can test the behavior of the TAG configuration directly from the Route screen.

* Click the _…_ button
* Select _Test_

This will open the _Test Routes_ screen, thus set the *Resource URL* to _/movies_.

image::test-window.png[""]

Add OAuth2 Authentication with the following steps:

* Click on `…` button
* Select `Add OAuth 2.0`
* Scroll down to the OAuth2 section
* Fill *Username* with _alice_
* Fill *Password* with _supersecret_
* Fill *Client Id* with _movieapp_
* Fill *Client Secret* with _tomitribe_

image::test-window-with-oauth2.png[""]

After that click _Test_. If everything was set up correctly, you will get a _200 OK_ in the Response, which means you were able to get a token with the provided credentials, and use this token to call the /movies route successfully.

image::test-window-with-oauth2-200.png[""]

If you try call the endpoint with username _bob_, password _superpassword_ instead of _alice_, it should return a _403_ because _bob_ doesn't have the role _Administrator_.

== Stop the Docker containers

After executing this tutorial stop all docker images so it does not overload your computer.
```
docker stop tag
docker stop movie-api
```

= Improve Security with OAuth 2.0

== Start demo microservice

We can reuse the ENDPOINT docker container we created from the Tribe quickstart guide. To start TAG execute the following command:
```
docker start endpoint
```

If this is the first time you run ENDPOINT, open a terminal execute the following command according to your operating 
system:
```
docker run -e MSG=BLACK -d -p 9090:9090 --name endpoint  tomitribedev/sample-endpoint
```

We can validate that our microservice is up and running by executing the following command: 
```
curl -i http://localhost:9090/color
```
You should be able to see the color microservice output:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Length: 5

```

== Run Tribestream API Gateway

We can reuse the TAG docker container we created from the Tribe quickstart guide. To start TAG execute the following command:
```
docker start tag
```
If this is the first time you run TAG, open a terminal execute the following command according to your operating 
system:
    
For linux:
`docker run --net="host" -de LICENSE=accept --name tag -p 8080:8080 tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway`

For OSX:
`docker run -de LICENSE=accept --name tag -p 8080:8080  tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway`

To see the TAG starting process log you can execute the following command:
```
docker logs -f tag
```

```
TAG is complete ready when you see the following message on the TAG log:
INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["http-bio-8080"]
INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["ajp-bio-8009"]
INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in 18348 ms
```

== Create a route to use the Oauth2 Security Profile

From the Dashboard page, Click on the `Routes` option to navigate to Routes Page. Click the Plus button on the upper right side and select `MOD_REWRITE ROUTE`

image::create-route.png["",600,409]

For MOD_REWRITE textarea put:

For Linux: `RewriteRule ^/oauth2-endpoint$ http://localhost:9090/color/ [P,NE,auth]`

For OSX: `RewriteRule ^/oauth2-endpoint$ http://host.docker.internal:9090/color/ [P,NE,auth]`

For Security Profile select: Oauth2 Profile and for roles use: Administrator. 

== Calling the endpoint
We can test the behavior of the TAG configuration directly from the Route screen. Click the `…` button and select Test. This will open the Test Routes screen. In the Test Routes screen set the Resource URL to `/oauth2-endpoint`.

Add OAuth Authentication clicking in `…` button and select the `Add OAuth 2.0` option. Scroll down to the OAuth2 section and add for the Username `ana` with the password `tomitribe`. For the Client Id add `clientid` with Client Secret `tomitribe`.

image::test-window-with-oauth2.png["",600,409]

When done, hit the `Test` button. If everything was set up correctly, you should get a 200 OK in the Response from Tribestream Gatway in Result Section.

If you try call the endpoint with Bob user, it should returns a 403, that’s because bob does not have permission to call the endpoint, just user with role Administratos is able to call it, so on the OAuth2 section add for the Username `bob` with the password `tomitribe`. For the Client Id add `clientid` with Client Secret `tomitribe`.
